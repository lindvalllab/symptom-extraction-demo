P: Uhm no that was kind of it, I just was wondering how we can fix her elbow.

D: I yeah certainly so. It will be so when I get an elbow X Ray. And. But typically to fix this type of injury, so currently I'm thinking this could be a like a radial head subluxation, and possibly a radial head fracture, but most likely I radial head subluxation, where there's a mechanism of pulling on a child's arm. And it's just that the what could happen is the part of the radius, which is that a forearm bone can pull out of the ligament that's holding it down.

P: OK.",Negative,MSK0027.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: An just because of the structures there, not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you won't really see much swelling or redness, and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal. But if there is a fracture which will look for an X-Ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction.

We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're going to keep having taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like for half an hour, like around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can you can take the, continue taking the Tylenol and Advil, as well.

Um, so um, in terms of like a management plan, you can try conservative things like ice packs, um, over the counter painkillers. Um, otherwise, we can try to um, put the radius back into its normal position here, which will just take uh, like a few minutes.

P: Mmmm

D: But if your symptoms are getting worse and you're developing a fever, it's becoming even more painful then certainly will have to rule out infection.

P: No, I, I can't. I can't move it at all.

D: Alright, so um, it sounds like you have a shoulder dislocation. Um, so we are going to do an x-ray of your shoulder joint first to make sure that it's, it's just a dislocation and there aren't any broken bones or fractures.

P: Okay.

D: Um, otherwise, we can keep it immobilized for a few days to a few weeks, um, depending on how bad the dislocation is.

"D: Yeah, for sure. So this has been going on for the last month. It sounds more like what's called mechanical back pain and due to the nature of your work having been lifting heavy objects for the last 30 or so years it's usually something that occurs with repetitive, repetitive work, and strenuous work like that that affects your back. And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So every time you flex you have some compression of your discs. So what we what we need to do right now is it's been one month almost and then usually we get imaging if the pain does not improve after six weeks of conservative management. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is",Positive,MSK0024.txt,True,True,True,True

"D: Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms.

The orthopaedic surgeon will uh, decide like which option is best for you after we refer you for a consult with them, and then after that surgery they'll likely refer you to some rehab, so physiotherapy will focus on improving your range of motion and strengthening the muscles in that area.

So at work, if you're doing repetitive movements, maybe not do them so much and take frequent breaks, you can try some like ibuprofen, we'll refer you to some um, physiotherapy to help build those muscles around that, that area.

think yeah, she's been having diarrhea for the last two days.

if they're able to follow instructions, and so that test requires a completely breathing out and following some instructions during the test. So since he's six, he might be able to do that. We we can try that. And then afterwards we'll see if he requires anything like an allergy testing or we will we might need to help manage his symptoms with a puffer, for example, like Ventilin and an  inhaled Cortico steroid, but those are just some discussions will have in the near future after we've done all these investigations.

There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms.

"D: Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.

Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get",Positive,MSK0022.txt,True,True,True,True

And so to help with this one of the first things that that can be done is trying to use like wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position, but also, uh depending on like if there is inflammation there NSAIDs might help a little bit like ibuprofen or or things like that. But the majority of the therapy will be kind of an activity modification, and if symptoms don't improve over a period of time, then surgery could be a potential option as well.

So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations.

P: No, I think that's all.

D: OK, I'm so right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called Dupuytren's contracture, but also we can't rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger. Based on the the symptoms, but the fact that you're not having a fever, you don't have pain kind of along the the tendon, you're not seeing any swelling or redness that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis.

Uh, and usually with the with the depending on what we find on the MRI sometimes it can be just conservative management, but however oftentimes you do require surgery, so it would be.

If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working.

D: OK, and how would you describe this cough? Is it barky? Is it harsh? Does it sound muffled?

P: Yeah, for sure.",Negative,RES0056.txt,True,True,False,True
"D: Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics.

D: OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?

P: I'd say like a 6.

P: No, no, nothing like that.

D: OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?

D: OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?

P: Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore.

D: I see, and does that help though? 

P: Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain.

P: Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.

D: OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?

P: Um I will take an edible like once a month.

D: OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?

P: Um I can, but it hurts.",Positive,MSK0046.txt,True,True,True,True

D: How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?

P: It's just when I'm moving the thumb.

D: OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?

P: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.

D: Does that hurt at all? 

P: No.

D: OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.

P: OK. 

D: And then hold your hand, sorry.

P: No, go ahead.",Positive,MSK0046.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.

P: OK.

D: Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.

P: OK.

D: And then bring your uh arm out.

P: OK. 

D: And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.

P: OK, yep.

D: Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?

P: Yes, that is very painful.",Positive,MSK0046.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. 

P: OK.",Positive,MSK0046.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.

P: OK. 

D: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.

P: OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you. 

D: Welcome, take care.

P: You too.",Positive,MSK0046.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: How may I help you?

D: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this start?

P: Oh, so the cough started about 3 days ago. Yeah, the shortness of breath has come on since then.

D: OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?

P: Yeah, not really. Actually, it's been well, but just bad after I cough.

D: So say walking up the stairs or doing any exercise doesn't make it worse?",Positive,RES0057.txt,True,True,True,True
"P: Not really, I've been able to do the same amounts of of activity I guess. 

D: OK, so there's really no relationship with activity with your shortness of breath. OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?

P: I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly.

D: OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago. Is it a dry cough or wet cough?

P: It's dry. It's a dry cough. 

D: OK, and there's no sputum production with it? Anything coming up at all?

P: I tried some over the counter stuff but it didn't help.

D: OK alright. Other than the difficulty breathing and the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?

P: Yeah, I've been really tired. I guess I've just sort of been  resting the these last few days and I've had a headache as well.

D: OK. Can you tell me a bit more about your headache?

P: Yeah, it feels like somebody is just squeezing the top of or just squeezing the sides of my head.

D: Have you had a headache like this before?",Positive,RES0057.txt,True,True,True,True
"P: I have, yeah. I usually get them when I'm dehydrated. Or maybe I haven't slept well. And that's also been the case for the past two to three days. Yeah, it's been kind of off and on, there are some times that are worse than others, but I've noticed that I had it for the most part for the last few days, OK,

D: Have you taken anything for your headache? Any pain meds?

P: Yeah, I've been taking some Advil, it's helped.

D: And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?

P: Yes, I would say, but both the cough and the shortness of breath has been getting worse over these last few days.

D: OK. Alright, well it sounds like you have multiple symptoms right now that started about 3 days ago. You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?

P: No, as you mentioned, the headache's there too, then yeah, that's everything. 

D: OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history? Do you have any medical conditions?

P: Yeah, I have asthma and GERD I think.",Positive,RES0057.txt,True,True,True,True

Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back.

So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well.

And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out.

D: Yeah, have you tried anything for it, like have you given him any over the counter cough medications?

P: No, we're a little scared to give him anything. He's so young. He's 2 1/2. We haven't been really giving him any medications to be honest.

D: OK any wheeziness?

And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more.

Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case.

So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year.

P: Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house.

D: OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?

P: Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely.

D: OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?

P: No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough.",Positive,RES0048.txt,True,True,True,True

P: Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating.

couldn't take deep breaths like I noticed that my breathing was getting a little bit more more shallow and now it's, especially when I'm coughing, it's like I really have to sit down and catch my breath.

D: Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?

P: Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing.

Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year.

D: OK, so you haven't actually taken your temperature, but it you just feel like you have chills?

P: Yeah.

D: OK, we could take your temperature today. And then the loss of smell and taste. Do they both happen at the same time?

P: No. 

D: OK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?

P: Not the loss of taste and smell, but like the other stuff when I just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously, but the taste and smell is something completely new.

P: Um, no nothing like that.

P: I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own.

D: OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?

"D: Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound?

D: So right now we just need to make sure that she's stable, like all her vitals. You know when she gets to the ER, they can give her the appropriate antibiotics as well. And based on that, we need to make sure her breathing get stabilized, so she might be in the ER for one day. If they think she needs to be on IV antibiotics in the hospital, she might be in the hospital for a few more days or even a week. So it's really hard to say right now, but our priority right now is to make sure she's stabilized in the ER.

P: OK. OK yeah, that sounds good.

It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those.

D: Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks.

And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing.

But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today just to rule out in or rule that out. If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days.

And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well.

Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia.

You can be having an allergic rhinitis or with the snoring and just the chronic congestion. You may be also having something called obstruct, obstructive sleep apnea. And there can be structures in your mouth, throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night as well, and that even the congestion might cause that as well. So yeah, we'll do a couple test first and then if required, we might need to do some imaging and even perhaps send you to an EMT specialist if we think it's obstructive sleep apnea there.

But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI.

Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures.

P: Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said.

D: OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?

P: Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one.

P: I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah.

Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next.

D: No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?

Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it.

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?

P: It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.",Positive,RES0217.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?

P: No, this one, this one's pretty small.

D: This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?",Negative,RES0217.txt,True,True,False,True

"D: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid.

P: No.

Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?

Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it",Negative,RES0217.txt,False,True,False,False

Uhm, what we can do is usually we just immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice. You can take some NSAIDS like Advil for pain to help you. And it should it should get better on its own, with some physiotherapy later on as well.

Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?

D: OK, and now let's do some um movements with your leg. Um are you sitting down?

P: Uh, yeah, I am.

D: OK, I'm gonna get you to stand up from a sitting position, does that, is that painful?

P: Yep.

D: OK, and then I'm gonna get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and um abduct and extend the hip uh while your thighs maintain in line with your trunk.

Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief.

"about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that.

P: Sounds good. 

D: OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into.",Negative,RES0005.txt,True,True,False,True

P: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that.

P: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.",Positive,MSK0028.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively.

In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any.

"D: OK. Alright, thanks Jessica. So just to summarize, you kind of had a three to four day dry cough with a little bit of fever, some headache, and just in terms was quickly reviewing then. So you have been bringing anything up. No one in contact with these recently been sick. You don't have asthma, your not taking any medications aside from Claritin, and your little brother might have been sick about two weeks ago with kind of a common cold and we're hoping to get out of this visit is just kind of next steps and where to go from here, correct?

P: Yeah, like, I just want to know if I have to like take medicine or something. 

D: OK. Alright perfect Thank you very much. You have any more questions?

"D: Sounds good, thanks Jessica.",Negative,RES0211.txt,False,False,False,False
"D: I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in.

P: Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues.

D: OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?

P: Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.",Positive,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?

P: Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower.

D: OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?

P: If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes. 

D: OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?",Positive,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True
"P: Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave.

D: OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?

P: Yeah, mostly just with the cat.

D: OK.",Positive,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True
"P: We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it.

D: OK, and have you had a cough?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?

P: Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now.

D: OK, how many days per week are you using that?",Positive,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True
"P: Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an ""s"", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one.",Negative,RES0007.txt,False,True,False,False
"D: OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?

P: Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said.

D: OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?

P: Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?

D: Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?

P: Oh no.

D: OK.",Positive,RES0007.txt,False,False,True,False
"P: Um not that. 

D: OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?

P: No, no that's it.

D: OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?

P: Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast.

D: OK, and any surgeries?

P: Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth.

D: OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?

P: Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin.

D: OK, and any allergies?

P: What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats.",Negative,RES0007.txt,False,True,False,True
"D: OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy
eyes or runny nose?

P: Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime.

D: OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?

P: I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything.

D: OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?

P: You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother.

D: OK and in what grade now?

P: And, I'm in Grade 11.

D: OK, and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in?

P: I like I like playing video games, I was really wanting to join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff, but then I heard like you can't when you have asthma. Oh so I I kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that?",Negative,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: Yeah, so it's something that we will look into today. I'm. I'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together. And that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before?

P: Uh, what is that?

D: So essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can, and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device.

P: Is that like when you breathe in that the tube? 

D: Yeah, exactly.

P: Yeah, like the last time I was here like couple months ago I did that and it said that, she said that my asthma was back.",Negative,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: OK. Right, thank you for clarifying. And so, so for the last few questions about. And your personal habits. I was wondering. I understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Do any of your friends do that?

P: I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot.

D: OK, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet?

P: Sorry I missed that.

D: Just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet?

P: Oh, well my mom always like makes me a lunch like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something. I'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner. It's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something. I think it's like pretty normal.",Negative,RES0007.txt,False,False,False,False
"D: OK, and are you currently sexually active?

P: Uh. Like I have a girlfriend. Just with her. Uh, like just recently. Yeah we started.

D: OK, and do you use a condom?

P: Yeah, yeah. 

D: Every time or sometimes?

P: Oh yeah, every time. It's not doing that many times, but yeah.

D: OK, great and um have you had any other partners?

P: No, no like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one.

D: OK, but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?

P: Uh no. 

D: OK, and I know this question might seem a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself?

P: No.

D: OK.",Negative,RES0007.txt,False,False,False,False
"P: No I haven't.

D: OK, great um. And in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before?

P: Like may my dad, I think he maybe had asthma when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now.

D: OK, and any allergies that run in the family?

P: Mmmm, like my dad also really. Dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So yeah, I think that's allergies.",Negative,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True
"D: OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma.

P: Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that.

D: Excellent.

P: K thank you.",Positive,RES0007.txt,True,True,True,True

But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything.

"D: Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?

P: Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp.

D: OK.

P: I have never had anything like this before.

D: No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?",Positive,RES0013.txt,True,True,True,True

"D: No? OK, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run, or you know, does it hurt more or does I mean sorry, does your shortness of breath get worse? 

P: Oh yeah, it was like going up the stairs, can't really breathe in after.

D: OK, how about when you're laying down?

P: I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy...

Um, but you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing pretty, when you take a deep breath in. So I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing.

Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important.

And if it's positive, public health will be in touch umm, to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, but it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year, so for that we can, you can just treat it with like supportive treatments. You know, like staying hydrated, uhm, good nutrition, good sleep and just keep an eye on your symptoms.

But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show.

I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may",Negative,MSK0045.txt,True,True,False,True

That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?

P: No, I haven't. 

D: OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin.
