"D: An just because of the structures there, not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you won't really see much swelling or redness, and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal. But if there is a fracture which will look for an X-Ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction.

Um, so um, in terms of like a management plan, you can try conservative things like ice packs, um, over the counter painkillers. Um, otherwise, we can try to um, put the radius back into its normal position here, which will just take uh, like a few minutes. Um, and, and then after we reduce it back into its place, um, she should have normal function of her arm again.

Although you're not having any fevers or chills so that makes it a little bit less likely.

P: Mmmm

D: But if your symptoms are getting worse and you're developing a fever, it's becoming even more painful then certainly will have to rule out infection. And as well if things are not improving, potentially a structural disease and any, such as a meniscal injury, or like a ligamental injury from all of the like kneeling and and repetitive movements.

P: No, just like how can I treat this?",MSK0024.txt,pain
"D: Yeah, for sure. So this has been going on for the last month. It sounds more like what's called mechanical back pain and due to the nature of your work having been lifting heavy objects for the last 30 or so years it's usually something that occurs with repetitive, repetitive work, and strenuous work like that that affects your back. And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So every time you flex you have some compression of your discs. So what we what we need to do right now is it's been one month almost and then usually we get imaging if the pain does not improve after six weeks of conservative management. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is",MSK0024.txt,pain

But otherwise it's kind of kind of just there, like I took some Tylenol and Advil, and they maybe take the edge off a little bit, but it's always there. And it's worse when I, when I take a deep breath then I really feel it.

D: OK, so it's worse. Is the pain worse when you're walking as well? Like out to get the mail?

So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be.

"D: Yeah, so it sounds like you have a hip fracture from your fall. Uhm, so, the way to treat this is a combination of surgeries and rehab and medication. So we will definitely look into the surgical option first, which is done using some internal repair with screws. Or, you can do a total hip replacement or a partial hip replacement. The orthopaedic surgeon will uh, decide like which option is best for you after we refer you for a consult with them, and then after that surgery they'll likely refer you to some rehab, so physiotherapy will focus on improving your range of motion and strengthening the muscles in that area. Uhm, and for management of pain, you can take ibuprofen or any over the counter pain medications for now. Does that sound OK?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much.

P: Uh, no, she was she was fine, just three to four days ago. Like before that she was her playful self. No issues. But yeah, it's for the last couple of days just this nonstop cough and the fevers is what's really worrying me. 

D: OK, uh, have the symptoms have gotten worse or stayed the same?

"P: She's, she often gets sick, like her brother goes to daycare and he brings a lot of bugs from there and every time he gets sick, she also gets sick. The last time she had like a similar cough was
around two months ago, but at that time I wasn't that worried because she didn't have any fevers.

D: OK, um, have you, has there been anything that you've tried to help with the cough or fever?

P: Uh Tylenol, I gave her Tylenol. It did help her a little bit, but then the fever came right back, uhm say like a few hours later.

think yeah, she's been having diarrhea for the last two days. 

D: OK, uh you mentioned liquid appearing stool, what would you say say, so I guess, could you comment on the consistency and colour?

I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that.

And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms.

"D: Yeah, so I think I it, X-Ray would be the first step here because from what you're describing, and particularly with the mechanism of the injury and where you're feeling pain can be a common cause of a distal radial radial fracture which is one of the forearm bones. And so yeah, we will need an X-Ray to look to see if there is a distal radial fracture. And it's not sounding like this right now, but another thing that will look for on on the X Ray of the hands too is a scaphoid fracture to make sure that that's OK, but you didn't have any pain in the area of the scaphoid, which is reassuring, but we still want to image and make sure, although that most likely thing would be the distal radial fracture an if that's the case, then there will be like we will have to go into a cast for a period of time.

Uh kind of pain and then in the in the soft tissues and bone around your kneecap. Uhm, and it's basically happens because of overuse, so vigorous physical activities that put repeated stress on your knees, like running and cycling, uhm, can cause that or just like improper sports training techniques. Uhm, we can do a few things that that'll help with the pain. So for a little bit, if you could hold off on the running that would be good.

"resting, uhm, so avoiding putting any strain on that knee using ice packs for several days, compression, so wrapping your knee in like an elastic bandage, as well as elevating your knees higher than your, then the level of your chest can help. And then with the sharp pain you could also also take ibuprofen for pain management. Uhm, yeah, so we can start there if it doesn't get better we can also order an x-ray just to rule out other things that could have caused this pain in your knee. And if none of those nonsurgical treatments work, oh sorry, I also forgot to mention will also refer you to physiotherapy to help you with the range of motion and strength and endurance.

D: OK, how about when you do that to your knees?

P: Uh, the knee I can feel a little bit of I would say it's more of a discomfort then tenderness.

"D: No, OK, uhm, so it sounds like what you may have is something called arthritis, which basically happens, uhm, when the cushions at the ends of your bones and your joints kind of degenerate over the years, and so bone can eventually rub on bone, which causes like the grading sensation and causes the pain. Uhm, and it's it happens in old age, it happens with wear and tear so to diagnose it, we we'll, yeah, we did the physical exam. We can also get an x-ray of your hips and knees which can have some findings that align with osteoarthritis and basically for now we'll try to manage it conservatively so you can take and sets like ibuprofen for the pain or acetaminophen for the pain. We'll also refer you to physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles around your joint and to increase flexibility and reduce that pain.

It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count.

"D: Yeah, so from what you're describing to me you do fit into. The age range and all the symptoms are kind of point towards arthritis, and in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis. Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get",MSK0022.txt,other;pain

P: Yeah yeah. I definitely do.

D: OK, so that would be, yeah, positive Tinel sign and do you get any, so if you flex both of your wrists so that the back of your hands are pressing against each other. And if you hold that position, do you start to get symptoms of the burning and tingling?

P: Um yeah, I do feel it as well there.",MSK0036.txt,numbness and tingling;other
"D: Yeah, certainly so it's sounding like a carpal tunnel syndrome which that the differential would be something like radiculopathy coming up up from the neck, which you're not having any neck symptoms and the positive Tenel sign and positive Phalen sign are highly suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, along with the nighttime symptoms and the burning and tingling sensation you're experiencing. And so to help with this one of the first things that that can be done is trying to use like wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position, but also, uh depending on like if there is inflammation there NSAIDs might help a little bit like ibuprofen or or things like that. But the majority of the therapy will be kind of an activity modification, and if symptoms don't improve over a period of time, then surgery could be a potential option as well.

D: Certainly one of the top things that I'm considering after hearing about your symptoms of having this cough and fever and being tired these last few days, especially with your husband being sick with nausea, vomiting, and not feeling well. That being said, it could be another type of viral illness, or possibly a bacterial infection.

D: OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?

P: No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?",RES0026.txt,other
"D: Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations.

D: OK, I see an when you're extending your fingers with like passive extension to do with your other hand do you get a lot of pain like along the tendons or the passive extension?

D: OK, I'm so right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called Dupuytren's contracture, but also we can't rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger. Based on the the symptoms, but the fact that you're not having a fever, you don't have pain kind of along the the tendon, you're not seeing any swelling or redness that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis.

P: Yeah um, what, what can we do for her um, to make her better? And are you concerned about her breathing?

D: Um, so the, the physical exam and the, the vital signs will really, will help with um, to assess her breathing and to see oxygen levels.

P: Yeah.",RES0135.txt,other
"D: Um, and um, this could be uh, caused by um, a viral infection, which could be something along the lines of uh, like a common cold type picture, and we can get like inflammation of uh, really small airways, um, and it can cause that cough, and fever, and some of the symptoms that she's experiencing. And also, um, these symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, um, and so it'll be important to get a COVID swab just in case. Um, but um, if that is the, the scenario, then it will be um, supportive care with oxygen, fluids and we'll make sure that um, that her, her breathing is uh, okay.

D: OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?

D: OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?

P: Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva.

D: OK, sure, Yep.

P: So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.

P: Yeah, I think so.",RES0055.txt,shortness of breath

If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test.

But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted.",RES0134.txt,fever;shortness of breath

Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today.

But also using Ventolin as well and we'll assess the need for potential, uh, antibiotics and also steroid if necessary and if his breathing gets worse or you're starting to hear that the wheezing is getting worse or his work of breathing is becoming more intense then certainly we'll need to add on some oxygen and possibly, some other therapies.

But it's, uh, and then, uh, also we'll get some blood work and a chest x-ray. But it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation. Which, so some of the shortness of breath, it could be coming from fluid, uhm, that has accumulated in your lungs and so, uh, we'll give you, oh, another type of water pill now, Furosemide, to try and help get rid of some of that fluid so it will help with the breathing.

Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing.

If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics.

D: OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?

P: Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist.

D: Does that hurt at all?

"D: That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint. 

P: OK.",MSK0046.txt,pain
"D: And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.

P: OK. 

D: Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.

D: OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?

P: Yeah, not really. Actually, it's been well, but just bad after I cough.

P: I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly.

P: Yeah, I've been really tired. I guess I've just sort of been  resting the these last few days and I've had a headache as well.

D: Have you taken anything for your headache? Any pain meds?

P: Yeah, I've been taking some Advil, it's helped.

D: And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?

P: Um, I don't think so like he, usually he's a really active kid and he has, he hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing but also I think he's just been tired in general.",RES0043.txt,cough;other;shortness of breath

Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back.

D: And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require.

And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out.

P: Uh, now that you mention it, yeah, like if we're ever in the basement or anything like that, I, I do start getting like kind of irritation um, in my throat, and that kind of, sometimes I have also coughed at those times.

You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?

Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs.",RES0124.txt,cough

P: Uh, yeah I would say, yeah, maybe like, like five or six, and it kind of started um, it was really infrequent and so it didn't really, well I thought it was just the usual smoking, but it's been getting worse over these last, over these past six months.

If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories.

D: OK good, has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?

P: Well, sometimes he will get a runny nose. He takes like Reactin or Claritin or some sort of allergy pill for that sometimes, but that's usually like the changing of seasons that will happen more often. 

D: OK OK. Does he have any allergies?

P: Yeah, to mostly environmental triggers. I'm not sure if the specific things are, but I just know it gets worse. Maybe in the spring, springtime?

"D: Yeah, so we're gonna since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him just to start so we can do, we can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like uhm so we'll start there and then we'll also, because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well, and maybe even do some like some basic blood work for him, and if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators like a short acting beta agonist as well as an inhaled corticosteroid because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID, he will also get a covid swab and you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours.

P: Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house.

D: OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?

P: Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely.

D: OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?

P: Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else.

couldn't take deep breaths like I noticed that my breathing was getting a little bit more more shallow and now it's, especially when I'm coughing, it's like I really have to sit down and catch my breath.

D: Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?

P: Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing.

D: OK, um so yeah, you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night? Or did you notice any other triggers like you know, the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough?

P: Uh no, not really. Like I've lived in the same place for awhile, no new changes and I've been barely going outside, so I don't think there are any triggers.

So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own.

P: Yeah, well if I lie flat, uhm it, it's uh, or sorry. No actually, the pain gets worse if I I lie flat or if I'm if I'm taking a deep breath in. But really, the only thing that helps the pain is if I try to lean forward when I'm sitting down.

P: She did have a cough 2 weeks ago, yeah.

D: OK, and did it just go away on it's own or did she need any antibiotics or any other medications?

P: I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own.

D: OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?

P: I mean, she goes to daycare so she might have picked something up from there. Yeah, last I checked, no one at daycare was sick like right now. But three weeks ago there was someone who was sick.

D: OK, any past medical history?

P: Um, no, she's been pretty healthy otherwis. 

D: Any issues during pregnancy or after birth at all?

P: No.",RES0067.txt,cough
"D: Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound? I know it may be very worrying right now.",RES0067.txt,other;shortness of breath

I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day.

D: OK, do you have any chest pain?

P: No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing.

D: OK.

P: So yeah, that's, that's that.

D: And you mentioned a cough as well. With the cough is it, has it been dry, or have you been bringing up sputum?",RES0098.txt,cough;other;pain

P: No.

D: Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?

P: Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time.

D: OK yeah for sure, uh, and do you smoke cigarettes?",RES0098.txt,shortness of breath

"D: Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you",RES0138.txt,cough;shortness of breath

D: Yeah, for sure. What started first?

P: I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that.

D: OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?

P: Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius.",RES0188.txt,cough;fever;other
"D: OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?

P: Yeah.

D: OK is he coughing at all?

P: He was yesterday but not really now. 

D: OK and was it a dry cough? 

P: I think so. I mean, not-nothing really came out.

D: OK, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?

P: No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment. 

D: OK. Does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?

D: Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?

P: Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer.

D: OK.

D: OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?

P: Yeah, no issues there so far.",RES0188.txt,poor appetite
"D: OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia.

D: OK, and so it's just on the left side. It never moves to the right side.

P: Well, like sometimes when I get ill its on both sides, but usually it's on the left side.

D: So it's just the congestion that's been going on for quite some time and does it change with the seasons at all?

P: No, it's just there all the time. Like I can't even tell. This is like my normal now, but my mom said I should get it checked out.

Uh and some of the possible things that can be happening is you might be having a sinus issue like a chronic sinusitis. You can be having an allergic rhinitis or with the snoring and just the chronic congestion. You may be also having something called obstruct, obstructive sleep apnea. And there can be structures in your mouth, throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night as well, and that even the congestion might cause that as well. So yeah, we'll do a couple test first and then if required, we might need to do some imaging and even perhaps send you to an EMT specialist if we think it's obstructive sleep apnea there.

So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms.

"D: OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all?

P: Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for? 

D: Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI. 

P: OK",MSK0012.txt,pain
"D: And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there.

So, continue to eat well and continue to drink lots of water. I guess so what we'll do is we'll do a COVID swab just to just to check if you have COVID or not. We'll also do a few labs to see how your electrolytes are, do your vitals to see if you have fever, measure your heart rate and do a physical exam and then go from there.

Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh  you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to",MSK0039.txt,other;pain

So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though.",RES0202.txt,cough;fatigue;fever
"D: Oh OK. 

P: Uh, 101 or something or maybe 100.1 if. But anyways it was so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know so he could have maybe got covid and like at school or something.

D: Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days. 

P: Mhm.

D: OK, OK so let's focus on the cough.

P: Itâs Friday. Its been more like like 3 days.  Wednesday is when he came home, and then um he. And then today is Friday. So yeah, sorry. 

D: Today is Friday OK. And um. OK, yeah sure uh so. Is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?",RES0202.txt,cough;fever
"P: Uh I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Yeah he yeah, its just like little cough.

D: OK, And. He is he. He's not bringing up any sputum or blood?

P: No.

D: No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?

P: No, no, not that I've noticed.

D: OK, how about short of breath?

P: Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general.",RES0202.txt,cough;fatigue;other;shortness of breath
"D: OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?

P: Mm I think it kinda just there the whole day.

D: OK, and it does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Uhm? Like harsh, what is what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?

P: Uh, I, just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud. 

D: OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?

P: Um like he's had colds before, but I haven't like. I haven't like you this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold.",RES0202.txt,cough;fever
"D: OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?

P: I think so 'cause yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.

P: No, I don't think so. 

D: No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?

P: Mm I don't think so.

D: OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids? 

P: I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.

P: I think those are fine. 

D: OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?

P: No. 

D: OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?

P: No. 

D: And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?

P: Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like. I mean, he broke his arm once, but that was it.

D: OK, um so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm.

P: Exactly, like nothing. 

D: OK, and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?

P: Yeah totally. 

D: OK um. And then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?

P: No, no, like everything is things really good.",RES0202.txt,fatigue;other
"D: Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?

P: Yeah, sounds good.",RES0202.txt,fever;other
"D: OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection.

P: OK yeah, that's good to know.

D: Alright, sounds great. Have a good day. 

P: You too thanks.",RES0202.txt,cough;fever;shortness of breath
"D: So I understand you're having some chest tightness?

P: Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out.

D: OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?

P: I think it's staying the same.

D: OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?",RES0216.txt,other;pain;shortness of breath
"P: No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady.

D: OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?

P: Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.

D: OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain? 

P: No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight.

D: OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all? 

P: Uh, no I can't say that I did.

D: Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?

"D: OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?

P: Kind of just all over. 

D: OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say? 

P: Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said.

P: Exactly.",RES0216.txt,other
"D: OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?

D: OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?

P: Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one.

D: OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?

D: OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?

P: I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah.

P: Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough.",RES0216.txt,other
"P: Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart.

D: No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?

P: Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.",RES0217.txt,other;pain

P: Yeah.

D: OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?

P: It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.",RES0217.txt,other;rash
"D: OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid.

D: OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain? 

P: No.

D: Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?

Uhm, what we can do is usually we just immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice. You can take some NSAIDS like Advil for pain to help you. And it should it should get better on its own, with some physiotherapy later on as well. However, if we find that on physical examination you are having significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain, we might also require you to get an X Ray of the right foot and ankle, as well as just your lower leg.

D: OK, so alright, and how long does it last when you do get it? Or is it just always there?

P: Uh, it's kind of just there, but then when it's getting worse like it lasts a couple minutes to, I would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness.

D: OK, sure. And are there things that make make it better or worse?

P: Uh, not really, I think it's sometimes moving around too much, but like nothing, nothing really causes it.

"D: OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief.

D: Yeah, certainly so right now the top thing on top two things on the differential would be gout or pseudogout they do have some risk factors for that, including a diuretic medication as well as alcohol and obesity are all risk factors for it. However, you also had a knee injection a week ago, which could predispose to an infection. So gout and septic arthritis are the two things that I am thinking about an, so we'll do a knee aspiration and send that off for some investigations and that will help us determine which what the cause is and we can choose the appropriate appropriate treatment.

D: OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.

P: There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that. 

D: OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that? 

P: Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions.",MSK0028.txt,pain
"D: OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively.

D: OK, and did her hips, did like was she able to walk afterwards?

D: OK, excellent. And were there any concerns throughout pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes or hypertension or any exposures to infections?

P: No, her mom's pregnancy was perfectly normal. She was born, like she was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks. She was breech at that time, which the doctor said might have to do with her clicking hips. But yeah, but since then or during pregnancy, no other complications.

D: OK, that's great. And. Uh, in regards to, you mentioned her hurt hip any other past medical history?",MSK0015.txt,pain

D: OK um and is there any pain to palpation over the hip or or knee?

P: Uh, if I if I press on it, I don't think she's in that much pain. It's mainly just when she's trying to walk or put put weight on it.

D: OK, and is she able to move the hip in a full range of motion of like flexion, and extension, abduction, adduction?",MSK0015.txt,pain
"P: Uhm, so she does. She is able to move it if she really tries. But it's mainly just the putting her weight on it and anytime she puts her weight on it is is when it really hurts.

P: Yeah.

D: OK, and any any muscle weakness when testing around the joint?

P: No.

P: No I think that's all just just was wondering what might be going on?",MSK0015.txt,other;pain
"D: Yeah, certainly, so a couple of things that it could be. One is that it can be common in this age group is something called transient synovitis. Where, which can happen in the hip where there's some inflammation and it causes some pain following a viral infection. And it sounds like she had a viral infection last week with the cough, fever and and runny nose and her. She was feeling a bit warm and maybe feverish today as well, which could be a sign with the lower kind of slightly elevated temperature, pointing towards transient synovitis, which is a condition that will be self limiting and can use anti- inflammatories to help with the pain such as ibuprofen, but also something that would be important to rule out would be is septic arthritis because it could could lead to damage of the joint, but this will be lower on the differential and then finally something to consider is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. And, but this",MSK0015.txt,cough;fever;other;pain
"would be more of progressive  onset, but if she's not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like develops a really high fever or a red hot swollen joint, then we'd be thinking more along the lines of septic arthritis and we want to reassess.",MSK0015.txt,fever;other

He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good.

But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?

P: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.",RES0199.txt,fever;pain

But then also sometimes it means that like it gets like this when I have my period and I don't have my period right now, but I you know I I could be getting it, but I also just don't wanna let it go keep going if I do have an infection.

D: Ok, so you still have quite a, you have a, quite a bit of urgency to go?

P: Yeah.

D: Kind of going more frequently, but I suppose the new thing you're a little bit concerned about is that it, it burns a little bit, it stings a little bit when you do urinate. Am I understanding correctly?

"D: Yeah, so um what it sounds like right now is that you have something called mechanical back pain. It's pretty common and um it can be anything from your spinal joints to the discs to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle. Um and a lot of these can be caused by um hard activity at work, um like carrying heavy things um and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that. Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and",MSK0017.txt,other;pain

P: I can't, I can barely breathe for like 2 days now and I've been coughing and been having like a little bit of pain in my chest.

D: OK, the pain in your chest, uh can you point point out or can you describe the pain to me, is that sharp or is it dull?

P: Um, it's hard to say, I haven't really had this before. Um, it's more like it just kind of hurts just in the middle and it gets worse like when I cough and when I if I take like a really deep breath, it will hurt, yeah. Does that make sense? 

D: Yeah, so the shortness of breath and chest pain, they occurred simultaneously right? On the same day, like 2 days ago?",RES0012.txt,cough;pain;shortness of breath
"P: Yeah, I mean now that I think of it, I maybe started coughing a little bit earlier than that. But when it got harder to breathe is pretty well around the same time that I started feeling more the pain.

D: OK, alright so let's focus on the coughing first. Are you coughing up any blood at all?

P: Uh, no, I haven't noticed any blood. 

D: OK. And how about sputum?

P: I guess I guess it feels like there's some like mucus, I don't know kind, kind of like spit looking, but maybe like thicker than that.

I'm normally really active like I I train for triathlons and I I'm not like a couch potato, right? And I feel like I've been just kind of sitting down.

D: OK. Um, do you have the chest pain at rest as well, or is it just with the coughing?

P: Like if I take a deep breath I'll have it. But no, I don't think not not like right now. Not like just sitting here.

D: OK. And the coughing, how often are you coughing?",RES0012.txt,cough;fatigue;pain;shortness of breath

D: Um, OK, so these night events that you're describing, are they more chills or night sweats?

work up like a chest X-ray to see what's happening in there. Um autoimmune stuff could be like sarcoidosis but unlikely 'cause it seems like this is an acute issue for you.

D: Yeah yeah it does sound like it from the timeline like you started coughing two days ago, and then the difficulty breathing or shortness of breath also two days ago and then the chest pain just seems like it's from you coughing a lot.

P: No, no, they said it's not like one of those allergies and it's just like it's just like the seasonal ones. But they're just bad. 

D: OK, sounds good. So you've seen an allergist. Any other doctors that you've seen in your life?

"D: OK. Alright, thanks Jessica. So just to summarize, you kind of had a three to four day dry cough with a little bit of fever, some headache, and just in terms was quickly reviewing then. So you have been bringing anything up. No one in contact with these recently been sick. You don't have asthma, your not taking any medications aside from Claritin, and your little brother might have been sick about two weeks ago with kind of a common cold and we're hoping to get out of this visit is just kind of next steps and where to go from here, correct?

P: Yeah, like, I just want to know if I have to like take medicine or something. 

D: OK. Alright perfect Thank you very much. You have any more questions?

P: No, I don't know. I don't have any more questions. I just like I can go home soon like lay down.",RES0211.txt,cough;fever;headache;other
"D: I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in.

P: Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues.

D: OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?

P: Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.",RES0007.txt,shortness of breath
"D: OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?

P: Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower.

D: OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?

P: If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes. 

D: OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?",RES0007.txt,shortness of breath
"P: Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave.

D: OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?

P: Yeah, mostly just with the cat.

D: OK.",RES0007.txt,other;shortness of breath
"P: We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it.

D: OK, and have you had a cough?

P: Uh, no, I don't think so.

D: OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?

P: Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now.

D: OK, how many days per week are you using that?",RES0007.txt,cough
"D: OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?

P: Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said.

D: OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?

P: Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?

D: Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?

P: When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times.

D: OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?",RES0007.txt,other;rash;shortness of breath

P: Uh, like. No, no.

D: OK. Bowel problems?

P: uh no, no. No, that's all good.

D: OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?

P: No. 

D: OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?

P: Oh no.

D: OK.",RES0007.txt,fever;nausea;other;vomiting
"D: OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy
eyes or runny nose?

P: Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime.

D: OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?

P: I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything.

D: OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?

P: You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother.

D: OK. 

P: Yeah.",RES0007.txt,other
"D: OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma.

P: Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that.

D: Excellent.

P: K thank you.",RES0007.txt,shortness of breath

But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything. Um, and then it just got worse and then a few hours ago is like I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep it's like it just hurts.

"D: Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?

P: Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp.

D: OK.

P: I have never had anything like this before.

D: No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?",RES0013.txt,pain;shortness of breath

D: OK, how about when you're laying down?

P: I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy...

It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing.

Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing.

"D: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.

P: For the past week,

D: Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?

P: Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago.

D: OK, and where is this pain located exactly?",MSK0045.txt,pain
"P: Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder.

D: OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?

P: So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain.

D: Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?

P: Uh any movement.

D:  OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?

P: Um I think um, like no, anything hurts.

D: OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?",MSK0045.txt,other;pain

P: Yes. 

D: OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?

P: No, I don't see anything like that.

D: OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?

P: Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily.

D: OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy?",MSK0045.txt,other;pain
"P: Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that.

D: I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?

P: Uh no, nothing like that.

D: OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?

P: No.

P: Yes. 

D: OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?

P: Uh, yeah I would say so.

D: OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?

P: It's pretty much there all day.

"P: Uh no, no.

D: How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?

P: I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.

D: OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?

P: I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.

D: OK, but otherwise it's not tender?

P: No.

D: OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?

P: Yeah.",MSK0045.txt,other;pain
"D: OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?

P: The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.

D: Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?

P: It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts.",MSK0045.txt,pain
"P: OK. 

D: For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?

P: OK, sounds good.",MSK0045.txt,pain

D: OK, so just to kind of get a timeline, what kind of started first?

P: So first, my nose was kind of stuffy. And and then I started having this yellow discharge from the nose and then I kind of lost some of my smell. And then now my head hurts. It's not even like, it's not like a headache, it's like a facial pressure 

D: OK. And have you had any of these symptoms before?

P: I think so, yeah. 

D: OK. And has it been getting worse would you say? Or do you feel that it's getting better?

P: Um, I would say it's getting worse.

D: OK, and right now what would you say is the most troubling symptom for you? Is it that pressure in your face or is it the congestion?

P: It's the...it's the pressure in my face. It hurts. 

D: Yeah, have you tried any medications, over the counter medications at all?

P: I tried some nasal sprays. And like decongestions but it's not really helping.",RES0068.txt,other;pain
"D: OK. And so you've tried nasal sprays? Have you tried any of those, like nasal rinses, or anything like that?

"P: Yeah, now that you mention it, it does feel like that.

D: OK, and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad? Or have you noticed it yourself?

P: Oh gosh, I hope not, no. No one said that.

D: OK yeah, sometimes with like mucous buildup it can affect like your breath as well. So yeah, just wondering. Any chest pain at all?

P: No, no chest pain.

D: Constipation or diarrhea?

P: No.

D: Any issues with urinating?

P: No, no issues there.

D: Any changes in your sleep or appetite?

D: OK, is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried?",RES0068.txt,constipation;diarrhea;other;pain;poor appetite
"P: Like just the positions of how I'm sleeping sometimes helps, yeah.

D: OK, so this has been going on for, just remind me again, like the last four day?

P: Yeah, the last three days, last three days.

D: OK. Do you have any other medical conditions at all that you've been diagnosed with in the past?

P: Um no, I just take some multivitamins. 

D: OK, and do you know if you have any allergies?",RES0068.txt,other
"D: Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?

P: No, I haven't. 

D: OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin. 

P: Sure.",RES0068.txt,other
"D: So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?

P: I haven't, I haven't, no. 

D: OK.

P: I don't feel hot though.

D: OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?
