# Symptom Extraction Demo

## Dataset description

The datasets required for the demo are available in the `data` folder. The dataset is based on simulated medical conversations obtained from [A dataset of simulated patient-physician medical interviews with a focus on respiratory cases, Fareez, F. _et al._ (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01423-1)

The dataset is a .csv file with at least two columns:
- `text`: the transcript of the patient-doctor interaction.
- `label`: the expected output. For symptom tracking (binary case), the label should be 'Positive' if any symptom is mentioned in the text, and 'Negative' otherwise. For symptom extraction (multi-label case), the label should be a semicolon-separated string of symptoms, e.g. `fever;other;trouble drinking fluids`

The dataset can include any additional metadata as columns, in this case you'll find the `source` field, which corresponds to the ID of the transcript from which the text segment was taken from.
